# rxstatebus
A rxjs based data bus coupled with a state engine with history handling.

## What's rxstatebus 
rxstatebus is a transient state engine (live and immediate history state) for live or data replay (stream) handling. It allows to process messages and to attach data to messages (hooks), while keeping all processes independant. Any process has access to their immediate history and any other processes (hooks).
